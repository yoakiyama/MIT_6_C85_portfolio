			<h2> Question:
				<br>
				Do those who identify as female in 2000 live longer than men to a greater degree than they did in 1900?</h2>

			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/trial_fig_1.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Line chart showing the total population of males and females in 1900 and 2000. Male populations are indicated by triangles, and 
					female populations are indicated by circles. Shapes for males and females in 1900 are left unfilled, 
					and those referring to 2000 are shaded. Lines connecting successive age groups are solid for year 2000, and dashed for year 1900.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Here, I designed a figure that attempts to communicate the data in its purest form. Since I am searching for a trend, I decided 
					to first use a line chart. Lines charts can be inherently suggestive of trends and allow viewers to follow them as they traverse 
					the x-axis</li>
				<li>We have four categories, Male 1900, Female 1900, Male 2000, and Female 2000. Within those categories though, the two male categories 
					and two female categories should have some shared relation to more easily allow for identification of Male and Female in the chart. 
					Here, I decided to use shapes for each point to indicate sex (triangle for male and circle for female). Similarly, the two 1900 
					and two 2000 categories should share similarities to allow for easy separation of the two years. To this end, I decided to use 
					solid filling for both the shapes and the trend line for the year 2000, and hollow shapes and a dashed line for the year 1900. 
					I elected to fill the year 2000 since it is the focus of the question, allowing the unfilled and dotted data for year 1900 to serve 
					as a baseline to compare against.</li>
				<li>But placing age (sorted) on the x-axis, the viewer can easily read the chart from left to right, observing the change in population 
					across the age groups, sex, and year categories. By showing the y-axis as population, we can see a clear change in overall population 
					levels in the year 2000 compared to the year 1900. While this latter feature is not the focus of the chart, it gives context for 
					the overall population growth between 1900 and 2000.</li>
				<li>Prior to actually drawing the plot, I thought that a line chart of the raw data would nicely communicate a trend. However, 
					the resulting figure does not easily communicate an answer for the question we asked: are females outliving males in 2000 
					to a greater degree than in 1900. One major reason that this plot does not effectively answer this question is due to the large 
					change in overall population between the two. The change in magnitude makes it difficult to see if there was any difference between 
					female and males at older age groups in 1900. It is possible that there is a meaningful difference, but just difficult to see 
					since the number of living people at those age groups was so much smaller than in 2000. Furthermore, the line chart allows for easy 
					traversal of a single group over the age groups, but forces the viewer to compute the difference between different lines. In future 
					visualizations, we hope to address both of these issues.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/trial_fig_2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Area chart showing the fraction of females (y-axis) in every age group (x-axis) in 1900 (top) and 2000 (bottom). Fractions between 0 and 1 
					that are occupied by males are shaded. Y-axis is ascending in an upward direction in 1900, and in a downward direction in 2000; that is, 
					the y-axis is symmetrized around the x-axis. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The first major change I made was to convert raw population numbers to fractions. This normalizes the population within every 
					age group and year, and control for any changes in total population between 1900 and 2000. This also allows us to better answer 
					the question at hand. Using these fractions, we can easily see that the fraction of females is indeed increasing in older age groups.</li>
				<li>I actually only started drawing one half of the figure before realizing that splitting the years across the x-axis in a mirrored 
					fashion may work much better than what I had originally planned, which was to overlap the area plot. What we now see is a funnel-like shape 
					such that it blooms as we approach older age groups. This shape nicely shows that females seem to make up a much larger fraction of older age 
					groups. It is especially apparent in the bottom panel for the year 2000.</li>
				<li>Lastly, rather than just showing the fraction of females, I include shading for the male area. I decided to do this to contrast against 
					the area covered by the female curve. In the bottom panel for the year 2000, we can see how the shaded area (fraction of males) 
					strongly decreases at older age groups</li>
				<li>Since it was not my original plan to split the figure and mirror across the x-axis, I did not intend to have an explicit hierarchy 
					between 1900 and 2000 -- this was mearly a by-product. This horizontal splitting makes it a bit difficult to compare the change in 
					fraction of females at older age groups between 1900 and 2000 since they are far away and pointing in opposite directions</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/trial_fig_3.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Area chart showing the fraction of females (y-axis) across age groups (x-axis). Age is symmetrized around center; age is ascending 
					on the left panel (year 1900) and descending in the right panel (year 2000). Female portion is shaded.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this final sketch, I took a risk and symmetrized the x-axis such that the age groups are ascending in 1900 to the left of the center 
					and descending in 2000 to the right of the center. Since the greatest changes in fraction of females occurs in older age groups, I 
					thought that bringing the older age groups to the center of the figure would accentuate the increase in female proportion at 
					older ages. While I do think that it does nicely highlight the strong increase, I could imagine that such a figure with ascending 
					then descending age could confuse the audience. </li>
				<li>By reorganizing the previous figure, the increase in the female fraction now points upwards for both 1900 and 2000, whereas the 
					increase pointed downward for 2000 in the previous figure. This change allows for a much more intuitive directional understanding
					of the trend.</li>
				<li>I also flipped the shading in this figure so that the female area was now shaded instead. I thought that shading the female portion 
					and leaving the male portion unshaded would accentuate the increase in female proportion at older age groups.</li>
				<li>After looking at this figure, we might wonder if it is even necessary to label male and female. Could we just keep one of the 
					categories since there is only a single degree of freedom. Furthermore, do we need to keep 1900 and 2000 separate, or is 
					there a way to merge the data into a single panel like Figure 1 had shown. We will keep these questions in mind when designing 
					the final visualization. Along the way, it is crucial to remember that we are trying to answer and communicate the central question: 
					do those who identify as female in 2000 live longer than men to a greater degree than they did in 1900 </li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Through this exercise, I explored three visualization strategies: 1) a line chart on the raw data to show the total population across age groups, 
		sex, and year; 2) an area chart to show the fraction/proportion of females across age groups, with data for 1900 and 2000 symmetrized across the 
		x-axis; 3) a similar area chart symmetrized across a central boundary parallel to the y-axis. The first figure stays true to the raw data -- i.e. 
		we do not perform any data transformations -- but the trends are difficult to see and the four separate lines force the viewer to compute and 
		evaluate differences between male and female populations in 1900 and 2000. The second figure introduces a transformation of the population into 
		fractions within age groups and year. This transformation allows us to easily control for differences in overall population and 
		compare 1900 and 2000. It also allows us to clearly show how females outlive males in certain age ranges, as the values depart from 0.5. The second 
		figure was symmetrized across the x-axis, which made it difficult to compare the increase in the fraction of females at older age groups in 1900 
		and 2000. We attempt to address this in Figure 3 by symmetrizing across a central boundary parallel to the y-axis, and sorting age on the x-axis in 
		ascending order in the left panel (1900) and descending order in the right panel (2000), such that the increase in fraction of females is centered 
		in the figure. While this design really accentuates the dominant population of females at older age groups and allows us to very easily compare 
		between 1900 and 2000, the descending age in the right panel may be difficult to process for viewers.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the final figure, I will focus on clarity. The y-axis and x-axis should be sorted in an intiutive way so that the audience can easily 
		process the data and visualization. I will also need to carefully consider choices of color so that I can emphasize certain aspects (e.g. 
		increase in the fraction of females in older age groups, particularly in 2000) while also being careful to not perpetuate any harmful 
		gender/sex stereotypes. I will also focus on removing any unnecessary details. For example, is it actually necessary to include male annotations 
		anywhere in the figure? Overall, a simple and deliberate visualization is likely going to most effectively deliver the intended message: females 
		in 2000 are outliving males to a greater degree than they did in 1900. In the final figure, I may also consider using the title as an 
		opportunity to influence the perception of the figure. Rather than providing an ostensibly objective description of the figure as the title, 
		I may use it to guide the viewer to an answer to our central question.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
			In this final figure, I present a overlaying bar chart of the percentage of people who identify as female across every reported age group. 
			The blue bars represent percentages in 1900, and the orange bars represent those in 2000. The two colors accomplish multiple tasks. 
			Most importantly, they separate the two years we are investigating: 1900 and 2000. Moreover, the transparency allows us to see the percentages in both years 
			despite any large differences. I decided to make the year 2000 as the brighter orange color to highlight the strong increase in 2000 compared to 
			1900. The brightness highlights this much better than a darker color would. Furthermore, viewers may naturally perceive colder and warmer colors 
			with smaller and larger, respectively. Thus, subconsiously, the viewer is guided to understand that the percentage of older age groups in 2000 
			are far more dominated by females than they were in 1900.
			</p>
			<p>
			Rather than show an area plot, I decided to use a bar chart since we are working with binned age groups. The bars provide a more accurate 
			representation of the discretized data over an area chart, which would connect neighboring age groups with an edge and suggest continuous 
			data. The y-axis ranges from 0% to 100%, and thus the shaded (bar) regions nicely visually communicates the proportion of each age group 
			who identifies as female. We can easily see from this figure that the bars and, by extension, the shaded area becomes much larger and brighter 
			at older age groups, highlighting that females do indeed appear to be outliving men and to a greater degree in 2000 than in 1900. To help 
			communicate this result, I also include annotations for the last bar for those aged 90 and above. We see that although both years have a 
			greater than 50% female population for this age group, the percentage is much larger (76% versus 57%) in 2000.
			</p>
			<p>
			The y-axis now shows percentage of females in every age group rounded to the nearest percent rather than fraction. 
			Whole-number ercentages may be easier to read and understand quickly than decimals, and thus this y-axis may allow the viewer to focus their 
			attention on other, more important parts of the figure. I also include a dotted line across 50% to help viewers compare to a perfectly 
			balanced 50%/50% split between males and females in each age group. This line also helps emphasize the strong departure from this 50/50 
			balance in older age groups, particularly in the year 2000. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Lastly, we focus on a title. Taking lessons from our reading group discussions, I found that realized that a purposeful title can have 
			help achieve conceptual and affective objectives. In my previous drafts, the titles were simple descriptions of the illustrated data. These 
			titles might be considered somewhat objective in nature. However, I realized that the title, which has the largest font in the entire figure, 
			may be an underappreciated opportunity to guide the viewer through the figure. By posing the title as a question, "Are females outliving 
			males now more than ever?", we can grab the attention of both females and males and provide the illusion that the viewer is answering this 
			question on their own. The term "outliving" may strike an emotional side to the viewer as well, given the sensitive nature of mortality. 
			Thus the title may prime people to ask why females make up a vast majority of older age groups in 2000, and what fundamentally changed 
			in the past century to cause this shift. It may even cause people to reflect on their own health and motivate them find themselves in the 
			older age groups in the future, though I do understand that it may have the opposite effect and trigger anxiety in some viewers.
			</p>
			<p>Some design options do not appear in this final figure. For example, while I considered changing the y-axis range from around 40% to 80% to accentuate the increase in the percentage of females, but 
			elected to not take this route. As discussed in class, we generally should avoid truncating the y-axis in either direction for bar charts, and 
			while it could be helpful in this case to further accentuate the increase in female fraction, the height of the bars would be much less immediately 
			interpretable and may mislead viewers.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Phase 1 was in strumental in guiding my decision making process for my final figure. I learned that predicting the pros and cons of 
		certain visualization strategies for new data is particularly difficult before sketching drafts. What seemed like compelling ideas, such as 
		symmetrized and mirrored x-axes, turned out to have serious drawbacks, particularly in ease of interpretation. Perhaps evaluating how design 
		choices affect the experiential component (Norman's definition) of a visualization is quite difficult before actually drafting it. 
		Furthermore, sketching with a pen surprisingly forced me to explore more visualization techniques than I would have if I had the ability to erase. 
		In my second draft, I did not intend to symmetrize the plot around the x-axis, but as I began drawing the top panel, I realized that the initially 
		planned figure would be too busy and not work well. Since I could not erase the draft, I realized that symmetrizing could help separate 
		the data into two regions and may better organize and communicate the data and trends. Moreover, By forcing me to 
		draft three figures, the assignment pushed me to sample the space of possible figures much more than I would have. Had I just been tasked to 
		create a single figure, I likely would have just tried to iteratively refine my first figure until it seemed good enough. I nice machine learning 
		analogy here is that these three draft figures helped me avoid optimizing in a single local minimum. 

		<br>

		I thoroughly enjoyed this exercise, and I plan on using similar procedures when drafting figures for research papers.
