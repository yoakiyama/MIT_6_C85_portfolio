			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords and Evictions</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What is the distribution of corporate ownership in the Boston area? How did this evolve over time?</li>
					<ul> 
						<li> During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates,
							people frequently accused large companies and investors of capitalizing on low interest rates to purchase
							residential properties for rent 
							(example article: https://stateline.org/2022/07/22/investors-bought-a-quarter-of-homes-sold-last-year-driving-up-rents/).
							Many believe that this purported increase in corporate ownership exacerbated 
							an already dire housing crisis across the country. Using our dataset, we will explore how corporate ownership rates in 
							Boston have changed over time. Do we see an increase in corporate ownership? </li>
					</ul>
				<li>Have certain Boston neighborhoods experienced larger increases in coporate ownership than others? Do neighborhoods that have 
					the largest growth in corporate ownership rates cluster geographically?</li>
					<ul> 
						<li> To better understand the evolution of corporate ownership in Boston, it would also be interesting to analyze how 
							these rates have changed in certain neighborhoods. As the area around Downtown Boston continues to be an attractive 
							location for companies and their employees, I wonder if these areas have seen larger growth in residential real-estate 
							investments by corporations. Seeing so many new condos and apartment complexes being built around this area, I hypothesize 
							that there has likely been an increase in corporate ownership of residential properties within the past several years, and 
							perhaps moreso than areas further away from Downtown. This geographic information may inform us about the 
							many variables that likely influence corporate ownership of residential properties.</li>
					</ul>

				<li>What does the distribution of owner vacancy look like in the Boston area, and how has it changed over time?</li>
					<ul>
						<li> 
							In the reading, "Housing Justice Beyond the Emergency", we saw that the increased presence of live-in landlords was 
							associated with lower non-payment and for-cause filing rates. Using this dataset, we can see whether certain neighborhoods 
							have increased in owner vacancy, which may give us an idea of areas that are vulnerable to non-paymemnts and evictions.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>What do Boston neighborhood demographics look like? Are there neighborhoods in Boston where there are substantially more 
					non-White residents?</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							In the same reading, we also saw that evictions disproportionately affect communities of color. Using our dataset, we 
							can start to look at racial demographics within Boston neighborhoods. This may help us better contextualize differences 
							in owner occupancy and corporate ownership rates across Boston.
						</li>

			<h2>Data and preprocessing</h2>
			For our exploratory analysis, we use the following data:
			<ul>
				<li><strong><code>Boston_Neighborhoods_Zipcodes.csv</code></strong></li>
				<li><strong><code>Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong></li>
				<li><strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong></li>
			</ul>

			Prior to creating any visualizations, we can check for compatibility of our three tables. We first notice that 
			<strong><code>Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong> and <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong>
			share the same data -- the only distinction is that <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong> contains
			additional data from the Census. Therefore, we will just use <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong>.

			We also notice that <strong><code>Boston_Neighborhoods_Zipcodes.csv</code></strong>, which maps zip codes to neighborhoods, is missing 
			Fenway, North End, and West End, which are all included in <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong>. 
			We therefore just add those three neighborhoods to the table along with their respective zip codes.

			Lastly, we notice that <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong> contains a column called 
			<strong><code>objectid</code></strong>. The values range from 1 to 24, but noticeably skip 2, 11, and 16. The metadata file does not 
			contain additional infomation regarding <strong><code>objectid</code></strong>. After downloading the official census data from 
			<a href="url">https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-neighborhood-boundaries-approximated-by-2020-census-block-groups</a>, we see that 
			the missing entries correspond to Back Bay, Harbor Islands, and Mission Hill, respectively. Notably, 
			Harbor Islands contains only zeros in the census data, likely because it is a National and State Park without residents.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/field_distributions.jpeg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				We start our data exploration by just looking at the distribution of our data. 
				This figure shows histograms to illustrate the distribution of every data field. While it may not be the cleanest plot in
				a traditional sense, these histograms are helpful in understanding the different distributions across the fields, as well as
				in identifying outliers or abnormalities in the data. For example, we notice that <strong><code>objectid</code></strong> takes values 
				that range from 1 to 24, but noticeably skip three values. Upon closer examination of this column, we find that it is missing 
				2, 11, and 16. The metadata file does not contain additional infomation regarding <strong><code>objectid</code></strong>.
				After downloading the official census data from 
				<a href="url">https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-neighborhood-boundaries-approximated-by-2020-census-block-groups</a>, we see that 
				the missing entries correspond to Back Bay, Harbor Islands, and Mission Hill, respectively. Notably, 
				Harbor Islands contains only zeros in the census data, likely because it is a National and State Park without residents. On the other hand,
				Back Bay and Mission Hill are residential neighborhoods. 

				We additionally notice several outliers across all of the fields, which we can examine more closely in subsequent visualizations. 
				For instance, we see clear outliers in the population in juvenile correctional facilities (labeled as <strong><code>juvenile</code></strong>)
				and the total population identifying as Black or African American (labeled as <strong><code>black_all</code></strong>). In both cases, these correspond 
				to entries for Dorchester. In the next visualization, we will attempt to explore how juvenile detention and Black/African American 
				populations have changed over time.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/frac_black_aa.svg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				In the figure above, I attempted to show the fraction of the population that identifies as either Black or African American 
				in each neighborhood between 2004 and 2024. We immediately see that the values are constant over time. Closer examination of the data shows that all
				Census-related data is consistent within a neighborhood over time. Upon closer inspection of the metadata, 
				we can see that the census data is based only on information from the 2020 Census. Given that neighborhood demographics often change 
				over time, we should be careful in generalizing this 2020 Census data across different years.  
				Unfortunately, this prevents us from conducting any temporal analyses using the dynamics
				of population data in our analysis of corporate ownership and owner occupancy. In future analyses, we hope to have data to better 
				understand how demographic dynamics are intertwined with changes in corporate ownership, owner occupancy, and evictions, the last of 
				which is also not included in this data set.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/corp_own_time.svg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This figure shows us corporate ownership rates over time for every neighborhood. We see that the rate of corporate ownership 
				generally monotonically increases between 2004 and 2024 across all neighborhoods. Looking at the spread of ownership rates 
				only in 2004 and in 2024, we notice that variance is substantially larger in 2024 -- standard devation of 0.03% and 0.08%, respectively.
				This suggests that certain neighborhoods likely experienced larger increases in corporate ownership than others over the two decades. 
				For example, South Boston Waterfront had a corporate ownership rate of 6% in 2004 and increased to 38% by 2024, whereas Hyde Park 
				only increased from 2% to 12% in the same period of time. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/corp_own_start_end_rank_correlation.svg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				In this figure, we are primarily interested in whether neighborhoods that had relatively high 
				corporate ownership rate in 2004 also show relatively high rates or changes in total corporate ownership rate by 2024. 
				Since we are interested rank, we can treat corporate ownership rate as ordinal data in order to evaluate this question. Here, 				
				we show a scatter plot of the rank of corporate ownership rates in 2004 on the x-axis 
				and rank of corporate ownership rate in 2024 on the y-axis. We fit a linear regression to these data (dotted line), 
				highlighting the 95% confidence interval of the mean in the shaded area. In both cases, every point corresponds to a single neighborhood. 
				We perform Spearman's rank correlation in order to statistically evaluate the correlation between rank in 2004 and in 2024. We see that 
				the rank in corporate ownership rate is generally preserved between 2004 and 2024 (p-value = 1.2 * 10^-5). That is, 
				neighborhoods with relatively high corporate ownership ranks in 2004 showed relatively high corporate ownership rates in 2024. Therefore, 
				during those two decades, there was no drastic shift in the landscape of corporate ownership rates across neighborhoods. The points 
				highlighted in red strongly contrasts against the other grey, unlabeled points. These are examples that stand out, as they deviate 
				strongest from the trend. These points show that South Boston Waterfront and East Boston both substantially ascended the corporate ownership 
				rate rankings by 2024, as we started to notice in the previous visualization. 
				East Boston, which started as the sixth lowest in rate in 2004, is now tied for the neighborhood with the fifth 
				highest corporate ownership rate. 

				While this figure shows that the relative ranking in 2004 is generally indicative of corporate ownership rate ranking in 2024, it is 
				possible that some neighborhoods that started with low rates had dramatic increases in the past two decades and vice-versa. In the next 
				figure, we will look at whether ranking in 2004 was indicative of the rank in overall change in rates by 2024.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/delta_corp_own_start_end_rank_correlation.svg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				In this figure, we show two scatter plots. In the plot on the left, we show rank of corporate ownership rate in 2004 on the x-axis 
				and rank of total change in corporate ownership rate by 2024 on the y-axis. Here, we see a weaker, yet still statistically significant 
				correlation (p-value = 0.02), suggesting that while the relative degree of corporate ownership rates in 2004 was somewhat predictive of 
				total change in rate by 2024, there are some noticeable exceptions. Highlighted in red are Chinatown, South Boston Waterfront, 
				East Boston, and Charlestown. We see that Chinatown tied for the highest corporate ownership rate in 2004, yet saw a relatively small change 
				in corporate ownership rate by 2024. Conversely, the other three highlighted points had relatively low corporate ownership rates in 2004, 
				yet experienced among the largest changes in rates by 2004. To get a better sense of the actual change in corporate ownership rates for 
				these neighborhoods compared to others, we include the right-hand scatterplot. Highlighted in red are the same neighborhoods, showing the 
				corporate ownership rates in 2004 on the x-axis and change in rates on the y-axis. We see that East Boston and Charlestown both 
				had relatively low corporate ownership rates (both 3%) in 2004, but skyrocketted to nearly 30% by 2024. On the other hand, Chinatown 
				already boasted the highest rate at 13% in 2004, but only increased by half the percentage points as Charlestown and East Boston. 
				In both figures, the confidence interval gives us an idea of the neighborhoods within the predicted trend, and the red points clearly 
				emphasize the examples we wish to discuss. Again, the scatterplot of the rankings provides us a visual understanding of the Spearman's 
				rank correlation. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/total_delta_corp_time.svg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				In this figure, we can study the total change in corporate ownership rates by zip code through a geographic lens. For each zip code, 
				we compute the average change across neighborhoods in the zip code. The map is colored by this change in corporate ownership rate, 
				using a gradient from light orange to dark red. The increase in saturation implies greater density/concentration, and the red color 
				highlights increasing rates. The figure nicely illustrates how zip codes near Downtown Boston and along the Charles River generally 
				increased the most in corporate ownership rate since 2004, while this change in rate decreases as we move further south. This provides 
				geographic context to better understand where corporate ownership rates seem to be increasing strongest, and we can use this information 
				in future analyses to better understand the implications of rising rates around Downtown Boston.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/own_vac_time.svg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				In this figure, we begin to explore owner occupancy rates similar to how we started analyzing corporate ownership rate. We start by 
				looking at how owner vacancy rates change over time. We compute owner vacancy rates by simply subtracted owner occupancy rates from 1. 
				This line plot shows owner vacancy rates in every neighborhood every year between 2004 and 2024. From this figure, we cannot see an 
				obvious trend in owner vacancy rates, but we do get an idea of the overall distribution of rates. We see high variance in owner vacancy 
				rates, ranging from roughly 30% to just below 80%. The standard deviation in owner vacancy rate in 2004 was 14%, and similarly 15% in 2024. 
				Looking closely at the lines, we see that some neighborhoods show increasing owner vacancy rates, while others show decreasing vacancy rates 
				during the same time period. In the next figure, we will look more closely at how neighborhoods show distinct changes in owner vacancy rates 
				in the past two decades. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/total_delta_own_vac.svg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This figure allows us to more clearly look at the total change in owner vacancy between 2004 and 2024 by neighborhood. The figure shows 
				a barplot sorted by total change in owner vacancy rates. It is also colored using a blue to red gradient, which emphasizes both negative 
				and positive changes in rate, respectively. The saturation also indicates the degree to which the rate increases or decreases. This 
				information redundancy via color and bar size, as well as the sorting of neighborhoods, allows us to easily interpret the changes in owner occupancy rate across the neighborhoods. We see that 
				West End had the largest increase in owner vacancy rates, while South Boston Waterfront had the largest decrease in rates. We also 
				see that the degree to which South Boston Waterfront decreased in owner vacancy rates is much smaller than the degree to which many 
				neighborhoods increased in vacancy rate.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/med_owner_vacancy_zip.svg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This figure illustrates median owner vacancy rates between 2004 and 2024 by zip code. Median rates are indicated by a blue gradient, 
				where greater vacancy is indicated by lighter shades of blue. I decided to reverse the gradient here in order to minimize confusion 
				since observers may generally associate darker colors with higher density. The map provides a clear illustration of how owner vacancy 
				rates are higher in zip codes along the Charles River. We see high density of owner occupancy as we move further south of Boston. 
				Connecting this information with our analysis on corporate ownership, we see that areas with large increases in corporate ownership rates 
				tend to also have lower owner occupancy rates.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/pop_white.svg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				In this figure, we illustrate the percentage of the population that identifies as white across neighborhoods. 
				We use both bubble size and color to communicate the percentage of white population, where larger and darker blue bubbles indicate 
				neighborhoods with a relatively larger white population. I experimented with other color schemes, including two-color diverging 
				gradients and a light grey to dark grey gradient. Ultimately, I felt that a two-color diverging gradient was not very meaningful 
				since there was no clear value to center the divergence, and the light grey to dark grey gradient was a bit odd since darker typically 
				indicates larger values/density but was confusing since we are showing the percentage of white population. Due to the synergistic 
				expressivity of saturation and bubble size, we can easily identify neighborhoods with small or large white populations. We can 
				contextualize this information with all of our previous analyses.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>The evolution of corporate ownership and owner occupancy since 2004 has differed greatly across neighborhoods in Boston. In the 
				early stages of our analysis, we found that certain neighborhoods, particularly those along the Charles River and port near 
				Downtown Boston have experienced much larger increases in corporate ownership rates in the past two decades. Some, such as 
				South Boston Waterfront and East Boston have seen relatively rapid rises in corporate investments. Later, we found that ownership 
				vacancy rates had a more complicated, bi-directional change over time depending on the neighborhood. Some neighborhoods, particularly 
				South Boston Waterfront. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A major limitation of our current dataset is that we could not analyze changes in corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy in the context 
				of evolving demographics. In future studies, it would be grealy beneficial to collect Census-like data temporally over the past two decades. Such 
				data would be particularly helpful for exploring whether neighborhoods with relatively drastic changes in corporate ownership and owner vacancy 
				have also experienced drastic changes in demographics. For example, I might expect to see such dramatic changes in South Boston Waterfront, 
				where corporate ownership has skyrocketed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Obtaining financial data on residents and surrounding businesses would also be interesting to explore. Are increases in corporate ownership 
				often accompanied by increases in the median family income in a neighborhood? Do small businesses in the area experience increases in revenue? 
				How does it effect the fixed costs (e.g. lease) of small businesses in the area? Do small businesses get priced out of their locations? Do 
				residential leases tend to increase with increases in corporate ownership? Are changes in lease costs paired with changes in racial demographic?
			</p>
			<p>	
				Lastly, given the dire need to better understand and identify neighborhoods with increased risk of evictions, we must also collect 
				data on evictions and non-payments. In the context of our readings, we may find important trends that would inform legislation on 
				corporate ownership and individual investments in residential properties. For now, we cannot be sure of how these variables interact.
