			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What is the distribution of corporate ownership in the Boston area?</li>
					<ul> 
						<li> During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates,
							people frequently accused large companies of capitalizing on low interest rates to purchase
							residential properties for rent. Many believe that this purported increase in corporate ownership exacerbated
							an already dire housing crisis across the country. Here, we explore the "WHERE" of corporate ownership in the Boston area.
							Are there specific zip codes or counties that currently show </li>
					</ul>
				<li>How does corporate ownership change over time across the Boston area? Did corporate ownership really increase during 2020?</li>
					<ul> 
						<li> Here, we explore the "WHEN" of corporate ownership in the Boston area. I hear about corporate ownership much more now than I used to, and many people believe that low interest rates during
						the COVID-19 pandemic triggered this increase in corporate purchases of residential properties. We will use this data to
						explore whether there was any substantial increase in purchases by companies during this time period.</li>
					</ul>

				<li>How many companies are represented in Boston area residential ownership?
					What is the cumulative distribution of corporate ownership in the Boston area?
					Are there certain companies that own a disproportionate amount of properties?</li>
					<ul>
						<li> Here, we explore the "WHO" of corporate ownership in the Boston area. During discussions about corporate ownership,
						a few companies, such as Blackrock and Blackstone, are most frequently mentioned. Using this data, we can begin to explore
						whether corporate ownership is somewhat uniform across companies, or if there are certain firms that are highly
						active in the Boston market.</li>

			<h2>Data and preprocessing</h2>
			For our exploratory analysis, we use the following data:
			<ul>
				<li><strong><code>Boston_Neighborhoods_Zipcodes.csv</code></strong></li>
				<li><strong><code>Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong></li>
				<li><strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong></li>
			</ul>

			Prior to creating any visualizations, we can check for compatibility of our three tables. We first notice that 
			<strong><code>Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong> and <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong>
			share the same data -- the only distinction is that <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong> contains
			additional data from the Census. Therefore, we will just use <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong>.

			We also notice that <strong><code>Boston_Neighborhoods_Zipcodes.csv</code></strong>, which maps zip codes to neighborhoods, is missing 
			Fenway, North End, and West End, which are all included in <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong>. 
			We therefore just add those three neighborhoods to the table along with their respective zip codes.

			Lastly, we notice that <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong> contains a column called 
			<strong><code>objectid</code></strong>. The values range from 1 to 24, but noticeably skip 2, 11, and 16. The metadata file does not 
			contain additional infomation regarding <strong><code>objectid</code></strong>. After downloading the official census data from 
			<a href="url">https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-neighborhood-boundaries-approximated-by-2020-census-block-groups</a>, we see that 
			the missing entries correspond to Back Bay, Harbor Islands, and Mission Hill, respectively. Notably, 
			Harbor Islands contains only zeros in the census data, likely because it is a National and State Park without residents.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				This figure shows histograms to illustrate the distribution of every data field. While it may not be the cleanest plot in
				a traditional sense, these histograms are helpful in understanding the different distributions across the fields, as well as
				in identifying outliers or abnormalities in the data. For example, we notice that <strong><code>objectid</code></strong> takes values 
				that range from 1 to 24, but noticeably skip three values. Upon closer examination of this column, we find that it is missing 
				2, 11, and 16. The metadata file does not contain additional infomation regarding <strong><code>objectid</code></strong>.
				After downloading the official census data from 
				<a href="url">https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-neighborhood-boundaries-approximated-by-2020-census-block-groups</a>, we see that 
				the missing entries correspond to Back Bay, Harbor Islands, and Mission Hill, respectively. Notably, 
				Harbor Islands contains only zeros in the census data, likely because it is a National and State Park without residents. On the other hand,
				Back Bay and Mission Hill are residential neighborhoods. 

				We additionally notice several outliers across all of the fields, which we can examine more closely in subsequent visualizations. 
				For instance, we see clear outliers in the population in juvenile correctional facilities (labeled as <strong><code>juvenile</code></strong>)
				and the total population identifying as Black or African American (labeled as <strong><code>black_all</code></strong>). In both cases, these correspond 
				to entries for Dorchester. In the next visualization, we will attempt to explore how juvenile detention and Black/African American 
				populations have changed over time.

				In the figure above, I attempted to show the fraction of the population that identifies as either Black or African American 
				in each neighborhood between 2004 and 2024. We immediately see that the values are constant over time. Closer examination of the data shows that all
				Census-related data is consistent within a neighborhood over time. Upon closer inspection of the metadata, 
				we can see that the census data is based only on information from the 2020 Census. Given that neighborhood demographics often change 
				over time, we should be careful in generalizing this 2020 Census data across different years.  
				Unfortunately, this prevents us from conducting any temporal analyses using the dynamics
				of population data in our analysis of corporate ownership and owner occupancy. In future analyses, we hope to have data to better 
				understand how demographic dynamics are intertwined with changes in corporate ownership, owner occupancy, and evictions, the last of 
				which is also not included in this data set.

				This figure shows us corporate ownership rates over time for every neighborhood. We see that the rate of corporate ownership 
				generally monotonically increases between 2004 and 2024 across all neighborhoods. Looking at the spread of ownership rates 
				only in 2004 and in 2024, we notice that variance is substantially larger in 2024 -- standard devation of 0.03% and 0.08%, respectively.
				This suggests that certain neighborhoods likely experienced larger increases in corporate ownership than others over the two decades. 
				For example, South Boston Waterfront had a corporate ownership rate of 6% in 2004 and increased to 38% by 2024, whereas Hyde Park 
				only increased from 2% to 12% in the same period of time.

				In this figure, we are primarily interested in whether neighborhoods that had relatively high 
				corporate ownership rate in 2004 also show relatively high rates or changes in total corporate ownership rate by 2024. 
				Since we are interested rank, we can treat corporate ownership rate as ordinal data in order to evaluate this question. Here, 				
				we show a scatter plot of the rank of corporate ownership rates in 2004 on the x-axis 
				and rank of corporate ownership rate in 2024 on the y-axis. We fit a linear regression to these data (dotted line), 
				highlighting the 95% confidence interval of the mean in the shaded area. In both cases, every point corresponds to a single neighborhood. 
				Lastly, we perform Spewarman's rank correlation in order to statistically evaluate relationships. 

				The left-hand panel clarifies that the rank in corporate ownership rank is generally preserved between 2004 and 2024 (p-value = 1.2 * 10^). That is, 
				neighborhoods with relatively high corporate ownership ranks in 2004 showed relatively high corporate ownership rates in 2024. Therefore, 
				during those two decades, there was no drastic shift in the landscape of corporate ownership rates across neighborhoods. While this 
				plot nicely

				In this scatter plot, the x-axis is the same as before, showing corporate ownership rank in 2004, and the y-axis shows the rank in 
				total change in corporate ownership rate between 2004 and 2024. Similar to the previous figure, we fit a linear regression to these data, 
				and calculate the Spearman's correlation between corporate ownership rate in 2004 and total change in rate between 2004 and 2024. We see
				a weaker, but still significantly positive correlation in this case. The weaker correlation suggests that while the degree of corporate 
				ownership rate in 2004 is somewhat indicative of relative change in rate during the two decades, there are indeed some neighborhoods that 
				defy this trend. For instance, we see that . On the other hand, East Boston ranked among the lowest in corporate ownership rate in 2004, 
				but experienced the second largest increase by 2024.

				In this figure, we can study the total change in corporate ownership rates by zip code through a geographic lens. For each zip code, 
				we compute the average change across neighborhoods in the zip code. The map is colored by this change in corporate ownership rate, 
				using a gradient from light orange to dark red. The increase in saturation implies greater density/concentration, and the red color 
				highlights increasing rates. The figure nicely illustrates how zip codes along
