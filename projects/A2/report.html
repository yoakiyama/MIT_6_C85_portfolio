			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What is the distribution of corporate ownership in the Boston area?</li>
					<ul> 
						<li> During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates,
							people frequently accused large companies of capitalizing on low interest rates to purchase
							residential properties for rent. Many believe that this purported increase in corporate ownership exacerbated
							an already dire housing crisis across the country. Here, we explore the "WHERE" of corporate ownership in the Boston area.
							Are there specific zip codes or counties that currently show </li>
					</ul>
				<li>How does corporate ownership change over time across the Boston area? Did corporate ownership really increase during 2020?</li>
					<ul> 
						<li> Here, we explore the "WHEN" of corporate ownership in the Boston area. I hear about corporate ownership much more now than I used to, and many people believe that low interest rates during
						the COVID-19 pandemic triggered this increase in corporate purchases of residential properties. We will use this data to
						explore whether there was any substantial increase in purchases by companies during this time period.</li>
					</ul>

				<li>How many companies are represented in Boston area residential ownership?
					What is the cumulative distribution of corporate ownership in the Boston area?
					Are there certain companies that own a disproportionate amount of properties?</li>
					<ul>
						<li> Here, we explore the "WHO" of corporate ownership in the Boston area. During discussions about corporate ownership,
						a few companies, such as Blackrock and Blackstone, are most frequently mentioned. Using this data, we can begin to explore
						whether corporate ownership is somewhat uniform across companies, or if there are certain firms that are highly
						active in the Boston market.</li>

			<h2>Data and preprocessing</h2>
			For our exploratory analysis, we use the following data:
			<ul>
				<li><strong><code>Boston_Neighborhoods_Zipcodes.csv</code></strong></li>
				<li><strong><code>Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong></li>
				<li><strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong></li>
			</ul>

			Prior to creating any visualizations, we can check for compatibility of our three tables. We first notice that 
			<strong><code>Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong> and <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong>
			share the same data -- the only distinction is that <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong> contains
			additional data from the Census. Therefore, we will just use <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong>.

			We also notice that <strong><code>Boston_Neighborhoods_Zipcodes.csv</code></strong>, which maps zip codes to neighborhoods, is missing 
			Fenway, North End, and West End, which are all included in <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong>. 
			We therefore just add those three neighborhoods to the table along with their respective zip codes.

			Lastly, we notice that <strong><code>Census + Corp Ownership and Occupancy Over Time.csv</code></strong> contains a column called 
			<strong><code>objectid</code></strong>. The values range from 1 to 24, but noticeably skip 2, 11, and 16. The metadata file does not 
			contain additional infomation regarding <strong><code>objectid</code></strong>. After downloading the official census data from 
			<a href="url">https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-neighborhood-boundaries-approximated-by-2020-census-block-groups</a>, we see that 
			the missing entries correspond to Back Bay, Harbor Islands, and Mission Hill, respectively. Notably, 
			Harbor Islands contains only zeros in the census data, likely because it is a National and State Park without residents.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				This figure shows histograms to illustrate the distribution of every data field. While it may not be the cleanest plot in
				a traditional sense, these histograms are helpful in understanding the different distributions across the fields, as well as
				in identifying outliers or abnormalities in the data. For example, we notice that <strong><code>objectid</code></strong> takes values 
				that range from 1 to 24, but noticeably skip three values. Upon closer examination of this column, we find that it is missing 
				2, 11, and 16. The metadata file does not contain additional infomation regarding <strong><code>objectid</code></strong>.
				After downloading the official census data from 
				<a href="url">https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-neighborhood-boundaries-approximated-by-2020-census-block-groups</a>, we see that 
				the missing entries correspond to Back Bay, Harbor Islands, and Mission Hill, respectively. Notably, 
				Harbor Islands contains only zeros in the census data, likely because it is a National and State Park without residents. On the other hand,
				Back Bay and Mission Hill are residential neighborhoods. 

				We additionally notice several outliers across all of the fields, which we can examine more closely in subsequent visualizations. 
				For instance, we see clear outliers in the population in juvenile correctional facilities (labeled as <code>juvenile</code>)
				and the total population identifying as Black or African American (labeled as <code>black_all</code>). In both cases, these correspond 
				to entries for Dorchester. In the next visualization, we can how juvenile detention and Black/African American populations have changed
				over time.
