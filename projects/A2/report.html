			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What is the distribution of corporate ownership in the Boston area?</li>
					<ul> 
						<li> During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates,
							people frequently accused large companies of capitalizing on low interest rates to purchase
							residential properties for rent. Many believe that this purported increase in corporate ownership exacerbated
							an already dire housing crisis across the country. Here, we explore the "WHERE" of corporate ownership in the Boston area.
							Are there specific zip codes or counties that currently show </li>
					</ul>
				<li>How does corporate ownership change over time across the Boston area? Did corporate ownership really increase during 2020?</li>
					<ul> 
						<li> Here, we explore the "WHEN" of corporate ownership in the Boston area. I hear about corporate ownership much more now than I used to, and many people believe that low interest rates during
						the COVID-19 pandemic triggered this increase in corporate purchases of residential properties. We will use this data to
						explore whether there was any substantial increase in purchases by companies during this time period.</li>
					</ul>

				<li>How many companies are represented in Boston area residential ownership?
					What is the cumulative distribution of corporate ownership in the Boston area?
					Are there certain companies that own a disproportionate amount of properties?</li>
					<ul>
						<li> Here, we explore the "WHO" of corporate ownership in the Boston area. During discussions about corporate ownership,
						a few companies, such as Blackrock and Blackstone, are most frequently mentioned. Using this data, we can begin to explore
						whether corporate ownership is somewhat uniform across companies, or if there are certain firms that are highly
						active in the Boston market.</li>
					</ul>
