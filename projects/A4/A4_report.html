    <h2>Proposition: White NYPD officers commit the majority of excess force and abuse of authority.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

					The bar plot shows the total number of substantiated complaints against every ethnicity in the dataset.

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> For this analysis, I removed any entry with any missing values, entries for which the complainant ethnicity was Unknown or Refused, 
					and entries for which the complainant age was less than 0 to maximize data quality.</li>
				<li>The color scheme: I employ a black background to set a dark, somber, and emotional  tone for the subject: 
					police brutality and abuse of authority. The black background also allows the red coloring of cases involving white police 
					officers. I colored all other ethnicities in light grey in order to place additional emphasis on cases involving white officers. 
					Studies have shown that darker contrasts of red often act as signals of dominance, aggression, and anger in humans and across many 
					animal species, and thus serves as an apt color for this emotionally charged topic 
					(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215610, https://akjournals.com/view/journals/1126/5/1/article-p161.xml).
				</li>
				<li>Labels: Here, rather than labeling "cases", I humanize each instance by setting the y-axis label to "victims". In this way, I hope 
					to generate an emotional reaction in viewers. I also use the word "Officers" rather "Members of service", which is the term used 
					in the official table. I chose to call them officers since for this purpose, I did not want to convey contributions 
					to public service. Lastly, in the title combats a colloquialism that is commonly used in the discussion of police brutality. 
					It also uses words such as "worst", "offenders", "abuse", "force", and "power" to incite emotion upon first glance.</li>
				<li>I elected to keep the y-axis in raw counts rather than performing any normalizations (i.e. fraction of cases or normalized by 
					the number of officers in each category). The raw counts allows me to humanize each data point by showing the total number of 
					victims in each category.</li>
				<li>Deception score: -1. By just showing the complaints as raw counts, this figure does not account for the total number of officers in 
					each ethnicity. This is crucial to consider when making the claim that white officers commit the most abuse. 
					Moreover, I am definitely aiming for affective objectives here, particularly with the color scheme, axis labels, and title. 
					Therefore, the visualization is certainly far from earnest or objective.</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/against.svg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
          The figure illustrates both the percent of instances [grey] and percent of police force [orange]. Data for complaints is taken between 
		  1985 and 2020, while the percentages of ethnicities in the police force represents that of January 12, 2024. The p-value, which is computed via a binomial test, suggests that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that white NYPD officers are 
		  disproportionately commiting excessive force and abuse of authority during this time period.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The data represented in this table used the exact same data as the previous visualization in addition to 
					NYPD Members of Service (MOS) Demographics data for Jan 12, 2024 
					(https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTI4OTRjZTYtNTYwOC00NzcxLThhYTItOTU5NGNkMzIzYjVlIiwidCI6IjJiOWY1N2ViLTc4ZDEtNDZmYi1iZTgzLWEyYWZkZDdjNjA0MyJ9&pageName=ReportSection). 
					I pulled this data in order to try to normalize the number of substantiated complaints by the demographics of the NYPD police force.
				</li>
				<li>In an argument against the proposition, this visualization appears to account for the total number of white and non-white officers 
					in the NYPD. </li>
				<li>A major difference compared to the previous visualization is in the categorization of NYPD officers. Here, we create binary categories 
					for ethnicity: White and Non-white. This combines the incidences of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian officers into a single 
					category, making the total incidences involving White officers appear much less dominant. </li>
				<li>RATIONALE_3</li>
				<li>Deception score: -0.5. A more appropriate analysis would use NYPD demographics from 1985 to 2020 rather than just using 
					data from 2024. </li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>There are certainly many ways to use the same data to argue two completely different stances. As we have discussed many times in class
		 and during graduate discussions, every visualization has some inherent bias, regardless of how objective it may seem. In the visualization against 
		 the proposition, I included a p-value to portray a sense of credibility, but the figure also included design choices aimed at de-emphasizing the 
		 role of white officers in police abuse incidences. I would not be surprised if others who used different data processing choices could find 
		 statistical significance arguing FOR the proposition as well. Data filtering as well as data processing decisions, such as what we consider to be 
		 "substantiated" cases, influences any statistical test that is performed.</p>
