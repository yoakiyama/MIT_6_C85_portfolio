    <h2>Proposition: White NYPD officers commit the majority of excess force and abuse of authority.</h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/for.svg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The bar plot shows the total number of substantiated complaints against every NYPD officer ethnicity between 1985 and 2020. 
					The total number of substantiated complaints against white officers is colored in red, while those against all other 
					officer ethnicities is colored in light grey. A caption is included next to the red bar and includes a p-value for a statistical test 
					that supports the claim that white officers disproportionately abuse their power and use excessive force.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> For this analysis, I removed any entry with any missing values, entries for which the complainant ethnicity was Unknown or Refused, 
					and entries for which the complainant age was less than 0 to maximize data quality.</li>
				<li>The color scheme: I employ a black background to set a dark, somber, and emotional  tone for the subject: 
					police brutality and abuse of authority. The black background also allows the red coloring of cases involving white police 
					officers. I colored all other ethnicities in light grey in order to place additional emphasis on cases involving white officers. 
					Studies have shown that darker contrasts of red often act as signals of dominance, aggression, and anger in humans and across many 
					animal species, and thus serves as an apt color for this emotionally charged topic 
					(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215610, https://akjournals.com/view/journals/1126/5/1/article-p161.xml). 
					Lastly, the text next to the red bar includes a caption colored in white. I used white text since the caption includes a p-value from a statistical test and 
					is meant to add credibility to the claims. I reasoned that colored text would detract from this message.
				</li>
				<li>Labels: Here, rather than labeling "cases", I humanize each instance by setting the y-axis label to "victims". In this way, I hope 
					to generate an emotional reaction in viewers. I also use the word "Officers" rather "Members of service", which is the term used 
					in the official table. I chose to call them officers since for this purpose, I did not want to convey contributions 
					to public service. Lastly, in the title combats a colloquialism that is commonly used in the discussion of police brutality. 
					It also uses words such as "worst", "offenders", "abuse", "force", and "power" to incite emotion upon first glance.</li>
				<li>I elected to keep the y-axis in raw counts rather than performing any normalizations (i.e. fraction of cases or normalized by 
					the number of officers in each category). The raw counts allows me to humanize each data point by showing the total number of 
					victims in each category.</li>
				<li>
					This figure is much taller than it is wide. I decided that this may emphasize the height (# of victims) of the bars to maximize the 
					emotional effect of each bar, particularly the red bar representing the number of victims who filed substantiated claims against 
					white officers. 
				</li>
				<li>Deception score: -0.5. By just showing the complaints as raw counts, this visualization alone does not show how the number of 
					substantiated cases may be related to the total number of officers in each ethnicity. 
					This is crucial to consider when making the claim that white officers commit the most abuse. To address this, I downloaded data 
					from NYPD Members of Service (MOS) Demographics data for Jan 12, 2024 
					(https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTI4OTRjZTYtNTYwOC00NzcxLThhYTItOTU5NGNkMzIzYjVlIiwidCI6IjJiOWY1N2ViLTc4ZDEtNDZmYi1iZTgzLWEyYWZkZDdjNjA0MyJ9&pageName=ReportSection) 
					and performed a binomial test where the null hypothesis is that there is no association between officer ethnicity and the number of substantiated complaints. 
					The resulting p-value suggests that white officers disproportionately abuse their power. This text may contribute to an illusion of 
					objectivity in an otherwise highly emotional figure, particularly with the color scheme, axis labels, and title. A limitation of this analysis 
					is that the NYPD demographics only considers data from 2024, rather than between 1985 and 2020, which the complaints dataset uses. 
					While the visualization has aspects of objectivity (raw counts and a statistical test), the design choices were deliberately chosen 
					for affective objectives.</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In an argument against the proposition, this visualization shows an incredibly simple barplot illustrating the percentage of 
					substantiated complaints against white and non-white NYPD officers. </li>
				<li>A major difference compared to the previous visualization is in the categorization of NYPD officers.
					 Here, we create binary categories for ethnicity: White and Non-white. This combines the incidences of Black, Hispanic, 
					 Asian, and American Indian officers into a single category, making the total incidences involving White officers appear 
					 much less dominant. Moreover, I converted the raw counts into percentages. Compared to the previous figure, which uses raw counts 
					 and labels the y-axis as "victims", this figure removes the human aspect from each case.</li>
				<li>Compared to the previous visualization, the color scheme in this figure is less dramatic. Here, we use a white background and 
					grey bars to show the percentage of substantiated complaints against each officer ethnic category. With this figure, I hope to not 
					trigger much emotion in the audience. Since this topic is generally emotionally charged, this simple depiction of data along with 
					mute color schemes may provide a sense of objectivity.</li>
				<li>In the title, I use the word "trivial" to try to emphasize a qualitatively small difference between the two bars. I also use the word 
					"complaints", which is what the original data table uses. "Complaints" certainly carries a lot less emotion than "abuse", "power", or 
					"force", and may conversely trivialize each incident since "complaint" may instead imply small issues. I also use 
					"members of service" and "service member", which are also used in the table, to emphasize that these police officers are serving 
					the public. These words may carry much more positive connotations than "officer" and "police".</li>
					<li>Compared to the other visualization, this figure is wider and shorter. This de-emphasizes the difference in height between 
						the two bars.
					</li>
				<li>Deception score: -1.5. Combining the complaints of all non-white officers visually diminishes the difference between white officers 
					and non-white officers. This visualization also does not consider the total number of white and non-white officers in the NYPD, 
					and thus does not provide crucial context. Overall, while the data used in both visualizations is almost entirely the same, 
					simple processing steps provide a much different visualization that seems top support the opposing side of the argument.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>There are certainly many ways to use the same data to argue two completely different stances. As we have discussed many times in class
		 and during graduate discussions, every visualization has some inherent bias, regardless of how objective it may seem. In the visualization against 
		 the proposition, I included a p-value to portray a sense of credibility, but the figure also included design choices aimed at de-emphasizing the 
		 role of white officers in police abuse incidences. I would not be surprised if others who used different data processing choices could find 
		 statistical significance arguing FOR the proposition as well. Data filtering as well as data processing decisions, such as what we consider to be 
		 "substantiated" cases, influences any statistical test that is performed.</p>

		 <p>This exercise also pushed me to explore with color much more than I had before. I had previously never used any non-white background color. 
			When I was attempting to maximize for an affective objective in the visualization supporting the proposition, I realized that the background 
			color could be incredibly powerful, perhaps even more so than the colors of the bars in the plot. Particularly in a visualization aimed at 
			triggering emotion, the color scheme can aim at accomplishing affective goals before the viewer even reads the title or processes the 
			presented data.</p>
		
		 <p>A particularly difficult part of this assignment was choosing a proposition that I could attempt to take on through an unbiased lens. 
			I reasoned that selecting an topic for which I did not have strong priors would allow me to most effectively produce visualizations for and 
			against the proposition. Given that I had not explored data regarding police complaints or thought too deeply about the demographics of the 
			police force before, I figured that this proposition would be appropriate for this assignment. Yet, I found that producing the 
			visualization against the proposition was most difficult, and I believe that much of the difficulty came from my exploratory analysis of 
			the data. One figure that I created during early exploration of the data had strong similarities to the visualization for the proposition. 
			To look at the distribution of officer ethnicities in substantiated cases, I produced a simple barplot that showed the number of cases for each 
			officer ethnicity. It immediately caught my eye, even when it lacked any ornamental features (axis labels, title, color, etc.). Seeing this 
			plot likely had a slight emotional effect. Of course, I understood that I should correct for the demographics of the NYPD when considering 
			the distribution of substantiated cases across officer ethnicities, but this initial reaction likely contributed to my initial difficulties in 
			brainstorming ideas to produce a visualization against the proposition. This is all to say that our prior beliefs and emotions 
			can strongly affect how we produce data visualizations, and they are important to consider during the process of exploring, analyzing, and 
			visualizing data for specific objectives.</p>
